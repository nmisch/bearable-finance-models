        "# Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a housing \"Rent vs. Buy\" calculator.  Like https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html and https://smartasset.com/mortgage/rent-vs-buy, the goal is to show the financial consequences of a housing decision.  This one adds realism in several ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Directs the renter to buy funds or stocks with the cash flow that renting liberates.  For example, if owning costs \\$5,000/mon and renting costs \\$3,000/mon, the rent model will invest \\$2,000/mon to close the gap.  (That is in addition to investing an amount equal to a down payment.)\n",
        "- Simulates more tax behavior.  This includes the [net investment income tax](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/net-investment-income-tax) and opportunities lost to the standard deduction, the [$10,000 limit on federally-deductible state taxes](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc503), the [\\$250,000/\\$500,000 home sale gain exclusion](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc701), and the [\\$750,000 mortgage indebtedness deduction limit](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p936), and [California's \\$1,000,000 mortgage indebtedness deduction limit](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2020/2020-540-ca-instructions.html).\n",
        "- Models the possibility that the person will donate assets or die before liquidating them, thereby avoiding capital gains tax.\n",
        "- Acquires market data history for user-provided ticker symbols.\n",
        "- Prints enough details to be auditable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The trade-off is that this requires significantly more user input.  If the New York Times calculator convinces you to rent, you may as well skip this calculator.  If that calculator suggests buying, try this one for a higher-precision estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "- For the latest code, visit https://colab.research.google.com/github/nmisch/bearable-finance-models/blob/main/Buy_vs_Rent.ipynb.\n",
        "- (optional) Use File -> Save a copy in Drive.  If you do that once, Colab will save later changes automatically.\n",
        "- Edit section **Parameters**, below, to fit the rent/buy decision you have in view.  Updating FRED_API_KEY is the minimum; all other parameters have usable defaults.\n",
        "- Use \"Run All\" in the \"Runtime\" menu.\n",
        "- Visit the **Results** section at the bottom of the page.  After a few minutes, **Statistics** and a graph will appear.  If in doubt, start with the mean and standard deviation in the table of statistics.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "- Models mortgages as fixed-rate, but proposes rates typical of adjustable-rate mortgages.\n",
        "- Models tax constants as fixed across years.  For tax rate tables and other figures to which a government applies inflation adjustments automatically, this model should do the same.\n",
        "- Does not model refinancing strategies.\n",
        "- Realizes tax savings monthly.  Ideally, one should realize them on the date when an actual tax payment is lower.\n",
        "- Invests and settles payables on the first of each month.  Payments like insurance happen once per year in the model, but some insurers bill on different schedules.\n",
        "- Uses a constant ratio of repairs to capital improvements.  In practice, that ratio increases over time, because your [cost basis can include only one roof, one HVAC system, etc.](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p530#en_US_2020_publink100011949)\n",
        "- Treats all dividends and capital gains distributions as [qualified dividends](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2020_publink100010076).  (Does not distinguish dividends on positions held less than 60 days.  Does not predict [payments in lieu of dividends](https://www.fidelity.com/tax-information/tax-topics/annual-credit-for-substitute-payments).  Does not model [tax-exempt securities](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2020_publink100010046).)\n",
        "- Assumes California.  In particular, residents of US states with low income tax may be able to deduct property taxes federally.  This model has the state tax capital gains like ordinary income.  That holds for CA and NY, but some states, e.g. [MA](https://www.mass.gov/service-details/tax-rates), have distinct capital gains tax rates.  Outside the US, there will be a lot to change.\n",
        "- Does not attempt to calculate \\$X in \"If you can rent a dwelling for less than \\$X, renting is cheaper.\"\n",
        "- Does not give a sense of total cost.  You'll take either the rent scenario or the buy scenario.  What matters is the relative financial positions of those two.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Development\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that changes reducing the recurring costs of ownership in this model may leave the ownership liquidation value unchanged and reduce the rent liquidation value.  This is a consequence of the renter investing based on the owner's expenses.\n",
        "\n",
        "See https://github.com/nmisch/bearable-finance-models for development history.  If you find ways to remove limitations or otherwise improve this model, please send a pull request.\n",
