# Bearable Finance Models

This is a project for financial models, currently limited to backtesting for the
decision between buying a dwelling in the United States and renting one.  The
model is a [Jupyter Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter).
To use it:

- Visit https://colab.research.google.com/github/nmisch/bearable-finance-models/blob/main/Buy_vs_Rent.ipynb
- Follow the "Usage" instructions under "Introduction"

If you test with other Jupyter Notebook implementations, I'd value hearing about
those experiences.
